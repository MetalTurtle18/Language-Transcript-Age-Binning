# Language Transcript Age Binning

This code moves language transcript files (.cha) into folders based on age (or average age if multiple child speakers) of child speakers.

My files are all from CHILDES in TalkBank, but I have not put any actual data into git.

This was just a script I created for a final paper in a language acquisition class.

### Future improvements
* I want to read in a json file with languages and pronouns (really, generic words to search for) instead of hardcoding them.
